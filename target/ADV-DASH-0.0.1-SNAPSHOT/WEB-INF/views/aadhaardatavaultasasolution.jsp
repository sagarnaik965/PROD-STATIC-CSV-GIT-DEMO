			<h3 class="headerColor">Aadhaar Data Vault as a Solution</h3>
			
			<p >
				<span >Data
					protection and privacy have always been a concern for individuals
					when they're involved in the various processes happening within the
					government structure. The existence of certain data always poses
					risks to the citizens' privacy, and most importantly, information
					that contains personal identity numbers. The Aadhaar number is one
					such identity for which its secure management while availing
					various Government services has always been a concern.&nbsp;</span>
			</p>
			
				<span >Therefore,
					UIDAI mandates the secure storage of residents' Aadhaar numbers in
					a separate repository known as &lsquo;Aadhaar Data Vault&rsquo;.
					All government departments offering citizen services and using the
					Aadhaar number in their application workflows are required to use
					the Aadhaar Data Vault for secure management of Aadhaar numbers and
					related data.</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: #212529;">&nbsp;</span>
			</p>
		
				<span >By
					establishing Aadhaar Data Vault, the UIDAI aims to enhance the
					security and privacy of residents' Aadhaar information, thereby
					reinforcing the overall integrity and trustworthiness of the
					Aadhaar ecosystem.</span>
			</p>

			<br />

			<h4 class="headerColor">Use Cases</h4>
			<ul>
				<li style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span
					style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The primary purpose of the
						Aadhaar Data Vault is to securely store residents' Aadhaar numbers
						and their related data.</span></li>
				<li style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span

						can verify Aadhaar enrollment for schemes with other departments.</span></li>
				<li style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span

						extend the secure storage of other identities and their associated
						data</span></li>
				<li style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span
					style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The solution can be deployed as a
						centralized identity registry for the secure management of
						Personal Identity Information (PII).</span></li>
