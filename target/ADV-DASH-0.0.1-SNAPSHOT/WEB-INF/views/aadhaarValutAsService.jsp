			<p >
				<span >Data
					protection and privacy have always been a concern for individuals
					when they're involved in the various electronic processes happening
					within the government structure. The existence of certain data
					always poses risks to the citizens' privacy, and most importantly,
					information that contains personal identity numbers. The Aadhaar
					number is one such identity for which its secure management while
					availing various Government services has always been a
					concern.&nbsp;</span>
			</p>
			<p >
				<span >Therefore,
					UIDAI mandates the secure storage of residents' Aadhaar numbers in
					a separate repository known as &lsquo;Aadhaar Data Vault&rsquo;.</span><span
					style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;"> </span><span
					>All government
					departments offering citizen services and using the Aadhaar number
					in their application workflows are required to use the Aadhaar Data
					Vault for secure management of Aadhaar numbers and related data.</span>
			</p>
			<p
				>
				<span >By establishing Aadhaar Data
					Vault, the UIDAI aims to enhance the security and privacy of
					residents' Aadhaar information, thereby reinforcing the overall
					integrity and trustworthiness of the Aadhaar ecosystem.</span>
